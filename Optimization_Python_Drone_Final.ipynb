    "# Drone Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "This script solves a drone routing problem using Pyomo for the `wt_1000` weight distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses `Centroids.csv` and `Drone_Links_Filtered_1000.csv`, which are created using `Network_Setup.ipynb`.\n",
    "- Assigns customer nodes to drones, minimizing energy while respecting payload and battery limits\n",
    "- Depot is fixed at node `9999`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This handles **one of six total weight scenarios**.\n",
    "- To run other scenarios, change `wt_1000` to:\n",
    "  - `wt_2000`, `wt_3000`, `wt_4000`, `wt_5000`, `wt_6000`\n",
    "- Also update the links file (e.g., `Drone_Links_Filtered_2000.csv`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce solve time, we did the following:\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Average distance to 20 nearest neighbors approximates intra-tour costs\n",
    "- **Depot averaging**: System-wide depot penalty approximates depot travel without full routing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints drone assignments, payload (kg), and energy (J). Repeat for other weight scenarios by adjusting the inputs as noted.\n"
