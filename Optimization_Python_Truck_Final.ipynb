    "# Truck Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "This script models truck-based delivery routing over eligible farm road segments using Pyomo and NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses:\n",
    "  - `Centroids.csv` (with `wt_1000` demand weights)\n",
    "  - `Grid_Lines_Melted.csv` (with line connectivity and eligibility)\n",
    "- Only lines with `Truck_Path == 1` are considered.\n",
    "- Objective: minimize total truck energy (travel + optional idling) to serve all nonzero-demand centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This run handles **one of six farm weight distributions**.\n",
    "- To explore others, replace `wt_1000` with:\n",
    "  - `wt_2000`, `wt_3000`, `wt_4000`, `wt_5000`, or `wt_6000`\n",
    "- All demand-dependent logic (e.g., centroid filtering and coverage constraints) updates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lines are modeled as nodes in a graph; intersections are edges.\n",
    "- Centroids are \"covered\" if at least one adjacent line is visited.\n",
    "- A depot line (`9999`) must be included and connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total truck energy use in megajoules (MJ)\n",
    "- List of visited lines\n",
    "- Count of centroids served (should match demand list)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies routing logic while ensuring coverage, helping evaluate energy needs for each weight scenario efficiently.\n"
